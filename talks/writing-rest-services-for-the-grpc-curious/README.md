INFOSUM

I work at InfoSum, a data collaboration startup in Basingstoke, UK. I have contributed to the Go programming language, and I run my own blog, mostly talking about Go and gRPC. Iâ€™m a maintainer of the gRPC-Gateway, the Improbable gRPC-Web implementation and other open source projects.

## Intro

Ever wished you could use gRPC for your new service instead of tired old JSON/REST? I will introduce and demo the gRPC-Gateway, which makes it possible to expose a JSON/REST interface while maintaining many of the benefits of using gRPC. It can even be used with browser clients!
