## CURVE

Curve is ‘connecting money’ by creating an over-the top interface, streaming the way you spend, send, see and save money. The beauty of it is that it does not require you to displace money. Instead it connects all your money into one interface with Read/Write permissions.

## Utility Warehouse

We're a supplier of home services (Energy, Telephony, Insurance & Broadband) with around 2% of the UK market, a unique business model and a huge potential to grow.

### Technology Stack

Our product and technology teams are a mix of new joiners and company veterans - a lot of the usual practices and processes still need establishing so it's definitely a good time to join and influence how things shape up in the future. Our current stack includes Go, React, GraphQL, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS and MongoDB.

## SONATYPE

More than 10 million software developers rely on Sonatype to innovate faster while mitigating security risks inherent in open source.
