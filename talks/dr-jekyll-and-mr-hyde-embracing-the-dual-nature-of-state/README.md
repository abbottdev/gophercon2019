## Intro

You are halfway through processing some business logic in one of your micro services then boom! something fails. This may be due to network issues, or a 3rd party API being down or a deploy of your service. How do you consistently recover from that failure?

This talk explains Lunoâ€™s approach to building application logic that is easy to reason about and robust to failures. The following things will be covered:

- Why good old mutable sql tables (where rows are inserted and later updated) are still a great way of storing and representing state.
- How using state machines to control state updates (explicitly defining the life cycle of a row) can help you to understand your business logic.
- When you couple a mutable table with an immutable event table (by inserting an event row for every update in the other table), you maintain a record of every change to your state.
- If you then expose these immutable events as gRPC streams, you provide a way for any microservice to react to a change in any other.
- How ensuring that if your event consumers are idempotent (able to process the same event twice) your business logic becomes robust to most failures.
- And finally, if you then explicitly introduce regular failures in your application logic, you start becoming confident about recovering when an actual failure occurs.
