# Energy Implications of Your Go code

Mahdi Jelodari

## Intro

Data movement accounts for almost 65% of energy usage in edge devices. It is important for every programmer to be aware of the energy aspect of their code, particularly when it comes to devices with limited energy budget.

## Relevance

It wasn't clear this talk was referring to Microcontrollers and hardware from the title of the talk, however we can draw alot of information from the subject regardless. Consider that, when we write code if we don't do it efficently - that we add unnecessary computation which uses energy which does not help the planet.
