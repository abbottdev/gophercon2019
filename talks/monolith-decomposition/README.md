DELIVEROO

## Intro

At Deliveroo, we had a scaling problem, which had some serious business implications. Luckily, Go came to the rescue! We picked Go up quickly and created a super-scalable service. I want to explain why & how we created this service, what we learnt & why everything we build next will be using Go.
